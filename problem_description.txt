Read and parse a firewall configuration file (SonicWall-config.txt).

1. Read access rule keys. e.g.:
access-rule from SHVPN to l3-trust action allow source address any service name application-default destination address name 10.129.101.254/32

2. Parse the read access rule keys into:
from  |    to    |  action  | source address |	   name	     |        service       |    name      |	destination address	|    name      |
SHVPN |	l3-trust |   allow	|      any	     |  <not needed> |	application-default | <not needed> |	10.129.101.254/32	| <not needed> |

3. Add every parsed entry to a CSV file.
